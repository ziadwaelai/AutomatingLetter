# Create User Endpoint - Fix Summary

## 🎯 Issue Found and Fixed

**Problem**: The create user endpoint was inserting data with **mismatched columns**, causing insertion errors.

### Root Cause
The Users sheet has **7 columns**:
```
email | full_name | PhoneNumber | role | status | created_at | password
```

But the code was:
- Only inserting **6 values**
- In the **wrong order**
- Missing the `PhoneNumber` column entirely

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Method Signature
```python
# Added phone_number parameter
def create_user(self, email: str, password: str, full_name: str, phone_number: str = "")
```

### 2. Fixed Column Insertion Order
```python
new_row = [
    email,              # ✅ Position 1: email
    full_name,          # ✅ Position 2: full_name
    phone_number,       # ✅ Position 3: PhoneNumber (WAS MISSING!)
    "user",             # ✅ Position 4: role
    "active",           # ✅ Position 5: status
    created_at,         # ✅ Position 6: created_at
    hashed_password     # ✅ Position 7: password
]
```

### 3. Updated Worksheet Creation
```python
# Now creates 7 columns with correct headers
worksheet.append_row(["email", "full_name", "PhoneNumber", "role", "status", "created_at", "password"])
```

### 4. Updated Endpoint
```python
# Extract and pass phone_number from request
phone_number = data.get('phone_number', '')
success, client_info, user_info = user_service.create_user(email, password, full_name, phone_number)
```
